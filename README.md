The final project of the Data Science Bootcamp with the Developer Academy:
This project used two datasets from Kaggle, one which contained samples of 5000 regions and an air quality rating based on environmental factors and pollutants concentration. 
The second dataset showed the average yearly PM2.5 concentration in 6985 cities between 2017-2023.
The project involved lots of EDA, creating a threshold limit for each pollutant which was compared with the WHO guidelines, 
creating a predictive model to get an air quality rating from the features, tracking PM2.5 levels across the years and identifying cities and countries with the worst pollution levels.
Two streamlit apps were also created, one to allow users to input a city and get the latest PM2.5 conc and a pollution rating, the other app allows users to input their own readings and return an air quality rating.
